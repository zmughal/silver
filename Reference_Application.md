# Function and production application #

Functions and productions are invoked with identical syntax, which is similar to C/Java's (i.e. uncurried):

```
<Expr> ( <Expr> ( , <Expr> ) * )
```

> _**Example:**_ invoking the _`substring`_ function, with three arguments.
```
substring(1, 5, "/path/file")
```
> _**Example:**_ passing _`foo`_ as a parameter to either _`a`_ or _`b`_, depending on the value of _`cond`_.
```
(if cond then a else b)(foo)
```
> _**Example:**_ constructing trees (given suitable productions _`add`_ and _`mul`_):
```
mul(add(1,2), 3)
```

Note that production application necessarily produces the undecorated type of the nonterminal it constructs. (See  [Decorated vs Undecorated](Concept_DecVsUndec.md) for more on the distinction between decorated and undecorated.)

## Partial Application ##

Missing arguments replaced by underscores will result in a partially-applied function.

```
map(add(3,_), [1,2])  =  [add(3,1), add(3,2)]
fun(_,_)  =  fun
```

Arguments supplied in a partial application are only evaluated once, so any expensive computation will be reused by the other applications of the same resulting function value.
