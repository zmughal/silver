Silver is a programming language that is being developed to investigate the modular development of language extensions and their composition.  In other words, Silver is a programming language for implementing programming languages, with a focus on making those languages extensible, and those extensions composable.

The goals of Silver include:
  1. Compose many independent language extensions with a host language _reliably_, without the possibility of conflicts between extensions.
  1. Permit a usefully broad class of extensions to a host language.
  1. Support the easy development of host languages and extensions in Silver.

Frontends for several languages have been implemented, including [C](https://github.com/melt-umn/ableC), Java 1.4, Modelica, and Promela. Numerous domain-specific languages have been implemented with Silver, including [RING](http://gemini.cems.umn.edu/research/bhan/RING.html), and Silver itself.

Silver makes use of the [Copper](http://code.google.com/p/copper-cc) parser and context-aware scanner generator.

Silver was developed by the [Minnesota Extensible Language Tools (MELT)](http://melt.cs.umn.edu/) research group at the [University of Minnesota](http://www.cs.umn.edu/) with assistance from the National Science Foundation, IBM, the McKnight Foundation, and [Adventium Labs](http://www.adventiumenterprises.com/).
