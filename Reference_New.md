## new ##

`new` is the inverse operation of `decorate`. See [Decorated vs Undecorated](Concept_DecVsUndec.md) for an explanation on what _`Decorated`_ means.

The following syntax will undecorate a decorated tree:

```
new ( <Expr> )
```

The _`Expr`_ is expected to be decorated; the result is the undecorated form.
